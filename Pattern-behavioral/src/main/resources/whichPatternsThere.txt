The behavioral group contains the most patterns out of the
Gang of Four patterns:

 -chain of responsibility(pattern that decouples a request from a handling object in a chain
  of handlers until it is finally recognized)

 -the command(pattern that lets you encapsulate each request as an object)

 -interpreter(pattern that you use to represent the grammar of a language)

 -iterator(pattern for providing navigation without exposing the structure of an object)

 -mediator(pattern is used to define how objects interact with one another, without having
  them refer to each other explicitly)

 -memento(used to externalize an object state, usually to provide rollback functionality)

 -observer(pattern is a decoupling pattern when we have a subject that needs to be observed
  by one or more observers)

 -state(used when we need to represent state in an application)

 -strategy(pattern that is used when you want to enable the strategy or algorithm to be
  selected at runtime)

 -template method(used to define an algorithm that allows subclasses to redefine parts of the
 algorithm without changing its structure)

 -the visitor(separate an algorithm from an object structure)
