Facade Pattern
Intent
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
Problem
A complex system with many components and interactions makes it difficult for clients to work with directly.
Solution
Create a simplified interface that performs many complex operations behind the scenes.
