Bridge Pattern
Intent
Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
Problem
Having a class hierarchy with multiple dimensions of variation, which leads to an explosion of subclasses.
Solution
Split the large class into separate class hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—connected by a bridge.
