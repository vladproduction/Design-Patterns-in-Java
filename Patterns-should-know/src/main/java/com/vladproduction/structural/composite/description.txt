Composite Pattern
Intent
Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
Problem
Need to treat individual objects and compositions of objects in the same way.
Solution
Define a unified component interface and implement it for leaf objects and composites.
