Adapter Pattern
Intent
Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
Problem
You have an existing class with a useful functionality, but its interface isn't compatible with the rest of your code.
Solution
Create an adapter class that converts one interface to another.
