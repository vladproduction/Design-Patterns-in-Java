## Proxy Pattern

### Intent
Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

### Problem
You need to control access to an object, or you need to delay the creation and initialization of an expensive object until it's needed.

### Solution
Create a proxy object that acts as an intermediary between clients and the real object.
