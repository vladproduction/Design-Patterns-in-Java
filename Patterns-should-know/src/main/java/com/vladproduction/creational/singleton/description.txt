Singleton Pattern
Intent
Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.
Problem
Sometimes we need exactly one instance of a class that is accessible from multiple points in our application, like a database connection or a configuration manager.
Solution
Make the constructor private and provide a static method that returns the single instance.
