Prototype Pattern
Intent
Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.
Problem
How to create exact copies of objects without coupling your code to their classes?
Solution
Create a prototype interface that declares a method for cloning itself, and implement it in all classes that need this functionality.
