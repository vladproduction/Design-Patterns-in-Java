Factory Method Pattern
Intent
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
Problem
Creating objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client, and allowing subclasses to provide their own implementations.
Solution
Define a separate method for creating objects, and let subclasses override it to specify the derived type of product that will be created.
