Template Method Pattern
Intent and Problem Statement
The Template Method Pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.
It lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
Design Solution

AbstractClass: Defines the template method which contains the algorithm's skeleton and calls abstract or hook methods
ConcreteClass: Implements the abstract methods to fill in the specific steps of the algorithm

Real-World Examples

Frameworks: Web frameworks use template methods to define processing pipelines for requests.
Data Processing: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations follow a template with customizable steps.
Document Generation: Report generators define a template for creating documents with customizable sections.
