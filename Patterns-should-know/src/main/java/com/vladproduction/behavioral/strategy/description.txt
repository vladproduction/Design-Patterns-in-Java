Strategy Pattern
Intent and Problem Statement
The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it, allowing you to select an algorithm at runtime.
Design Solution

Strategy: Declares an interface common to all supported algorithms
ConcreteStrategy: Implements the algorithm using the Strategy interface
Context: Maintains a reference to a Strategy object and delegates it to execute the algorithm

Real-World Examples

Payment Processing: E-commerce platforms implement different payment methods.
Sorting Algorithms: Applications can choose different sorting algorithms based on data characteristics.
Compression Strategies: File compression software can use different compression algorithms depending on file type.
